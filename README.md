# Find my zipcode

Been a place, and wondered what your zipcode or postal code is? This website
figures this out for you.

Live @ [bit.ly/postal-code](http://bit.ly/postal-code).

## How does it work?

We ask for your location, and then we use Google's APIs to figure it out for
you. At least that's the plan.

## How do I contribute?

Create a pull request, and if we like it (and you want to), we'll give you
commit rights on this repo. It's that easy.

## Development

Developing is easy as 1-2-3:

```
# 1: Install dependencies
npm install

# 2: Start a watch task to continuously rebuild assets
npm run watch

# 3: Start the web server
npm start
```
